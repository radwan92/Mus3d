#Mus3d

Dynamically loaded Wolf3D reconstruction.

Initially developed as an easter egg embedded in a *secret* VR (GearVR) app.

The idea behind the project is to be able to load the whole Wolf3D "game engine" in any app / game at any time. Adding this to any unity project should be as easy as possible, possibly requiring no user interaction beside importing a package. All the Wolf3D assets (graphics, sounds) should be either automatically downloaded in editor or at runtime when requested. A little bit of extensibility / moddability should be possible.

Project is developed solely by me and so at the current state my brain is the only source of information on what is needed to bring it to life. If you'd like to try it out feel free to mail/PM me.
